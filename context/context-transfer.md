# AWS NIST 800-53 Compliance Checker POC - Project Context

## Project Overview

This is a Python-based proof-of-concept application that validates AWS environments for compliance with NIST 800-53 security framework. It runs 15 pre-configured security checks from various frameworks (CIS Benchmark, OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK) and maps them to NIST controls.

## Current State

### What's Been Built

1. **Core Application** - Fully functional compliance checker with:
   - 15 security checks across IAM, S3, EC2, CloudTrail, VPC, RDS, Config
   - Multi-region scanning capability
   - NIST 800-53 control mapping
   - Three report formats: CSV, Markdown, JSON

2. **Architecture**:
   - `aws_connector.py` - Contains all security check implementations
   - `report_generator.py` - Generates compliance reports
   - `main.py` - CLI interface using Click
   - `run_compliance_check.sh` - Bash wrapper for easy execution

3. **Key Features Implemented**:
   - ✅ AWS authentication (access keys, session tokens)
   - ✅ Configurable check execution (by severity, specific checks)
   - ✅ Multi-format reporting
   - ✅ Git repository support for custom checks
   - ✅ NIST control family organization in reports

### What's NOT Built Yet

From the original feature document (FEA-007), these components are missing:

1. **Web Dashboard** - No UI, only CLI
2. **Real-time Monitoring** - Only on-demand scanning
3. **Claude AI Integration** - Placeholder for AI-powered test generation
4. **Database Storage** - No persistence, only file outputs
5. **User Assignment System** - No user management
6. **Scheduling Service** - No automated scheduling
7. **API Layer** - Direct execution only

11. CHECK-011: Unused IAM Credentials (AC-2)
12. CHECK-012: EC2 IMDSv2 Enforcement (AC-3, CM-7)
13. CHECK-013: VPC Flow Logs (AU-2, AU-3)
14. CHECK-014: RDS Encryption (SC-28)
15. CHECK-015: Config Service Enabled (CM-2, CM-8)

## Next Development Phase

### Priority 1: Complete Standalone Script POC

1. **Complete Checks for NIST 800-53**
   - Add extensive suite of all the AWS tests/checks for OWASP, MITRE, CIS, and AWS Well Architected to have full coverage of NIST 800-53 framework.
   - Map tests to specific controls within NIST 800-53
   - Ensure we account for longer running scripts since there are many more checks to run

2. **Update and Enhance Reports**
   - The reports currently only provide detailed findings for checks that failed, we should also provide the detailed findings for the checks that passed under each control
   - The csv report should have a column that gives a detailed description of the check that was run.

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Ensure the readme, other documentation files and related scripts are updated to match the new checks and updates to code.

### Priority 2: Web Application Foundation

1. **API Layer** (NestJS or FastAPI)
   - Wrap existing checks in REST endpoints
   - Add authentication/authorization
   - Implement async job processing

2. **Database Integration**
   - PostgreSQL for main data
   - TimescaleDB for time-series metrics
   - Store test results and history

3. **Frontend Dashboard** (React)
   - Monitoring dashboard component
   - Test management interface
   - Findings display with filtering

### Priority 3: Continuous Monitoring

1. **Scheduling Service**
   - Cron-based test execution
   - Queue management (Bull/Redis)
   - Notification system

2. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket integration
   - Live compliance status
   - Alert mechanisms

### Priority 4: AI Integration

1. **Claude Integration**
   - Test generation from prompts
   - Remediation recommendations
   - Custom check creation

## Key Design Decisions Made

1. **Consolidated Checks** - All checks in one file vs modular (chose consolidated for POC simplicity)
2. **No Database** - File-based outputs for POC
3. **CLI First** - Built as command-line tool before web UI
4. **Read-Only** - Only assessment, no remediation actions
5. **Multi-Region** - Scans all regions by default

## Code Patterns to Maintain

### Check Implementation Pattern

```python
def check_[service]_[issue](self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    findings = []
    try:
        # Get AWS client
        # Paginate through resources
        # Check compliance condition
        # Add findings if non-compliant
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
    return findings
```

### Report Generation Pattern

- Executive summary with statistics
- Findings grouped by NIST control families
- Detailed appendix with all checks

## Integration Points for Full Application

1. **System/Entity Context** - Need to add multi-tenant support
2. **Compliance Module** - Bidirectional sync with compliance pages
3. **User Management** - Assignment and ownership tracking
4. **Audit Trail** - All actions logged

## Known Issues/Limitations

1. **Performance** - Full scan can take 5-10 minutes for large environments
2. **Rate Limiting** - No backoff strategy implemented
3. **Error Handling** - Basic, needs improvement for production
4. **Testing** - No unit tests yet
5. **Documentation** - API documentation needed

## Environment Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- AWS CLI configured or credentials
- Read-only IAM permissions
- Git (optional, for custom checks)

## Questions for Next Phase

1. Database schema design for test results?
2. API authentication strategy (JWT, OAuth)?
3. Frontend framework preferences beyond React?
4. Deployment target (AWS, Kubernetes)?
5. Multi-tenant architecture approach?

## Original Vision

The feature document (FEA-007) envisions a complete monitoring platform with:

- Unified dashboard across multiple environments
- AI-powered test generation
- Real-time compliance tracking
- User assignment and notifications
- Bidirectional compliance integration

Current POC provides the core engine for this vision.
