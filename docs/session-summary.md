# Session Summary: NIST Compliance Script Enhancement

## Accomplishments

### 1. Documentation and Context Management

- Created comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` file for AI-assisted development
- Merged and consolidated documentation from context-transfer.md
- Removed redundant context folder

### 2. Code Quality Infrastructure

- Implemented pre-commit hooks with multiple tools:
  - Python: black, flake8, isort, mypy, bandit
  - Shell: shellcheck
  - Markdown: markdownlint
  - Git: gitlint (conventional commits)
- Created setup scripts and configuration files
- Established commit message standards

### 3. AWS Security Checks Expansion (Priority 1 ✅)

- **Expanded from 15 to 40 security checks** (167% increase)
- Added 25 new security check functions in `aws_connector.py`
- Updated `checks_config.json` with all new check definitions

### 4. NIST Control Coverage Enhancement

- **Original**: 5 control families (AC, AU, CM, IA, SC)
- **Now**: 8 control families with expanded controls:
  - Added: SI (System and Information Integrity)
  - Added: IR (Incident Response)
  - Added: CP (Contingency Planning)
  - Expanded: AC-4, SC-12/13/20/21, AU-4/11

### 5. New Security Checks by Category

#### System and Information Integrity (SI)

- CHECK-016: CloudWatch Anomaly Detection
- CHECK-017: GuardDuty Enabled
- CHECK-018: AWS Inspector Assessments
- CHECK-019: Systems Manager Patch Compliance
- CHECK-020: Security Hub Enabled

#### Incident Response (IR)

- CHECK-021: CloudWatch Alarms for Security Events
- CHECK-022: SNS Topics for Security Notifications

#### Data Protection & Encryption

- CHECK-023: KMS Key Rotation
- CHECK-024: Secrets Manager Usage
- CHECK-025: VPC Endpoint Usage
- CHECK-026: EFS Encryption
- CHECK-027: DynamoDB Encryption
- CHECK-028: ElastiCache Encryption

#### Network Security

- CHECK-029: Network ACL Rules
- CHECK-030: AWS WAF Enabled
- CHECK-031: CloudFront Security Headers

#### Identity and Access Management

- CHECK-032: IAM Roles for Service Accounts
- CHECK-033: Cross-Account Access Review

#### Backup and Recovery

- CHECK-034: AWS Backup Plans
- CHECK-035: RDS Automated Backups

#### Monitoring and Logging

- CHECK-036: CloudWatch Logs Retention
- CHECK-037: API Gateway Logging
- CHECK-038: Lambda Function Logging
- CHECK-039: CloudTrail KMS Encryption
- CHECK-040: S3 Bucket Logging

### 6. Service Handling Insights

- Script gracefully handles unused AWS services
- Service availability checks prevent errors
- Some services report "not enabled" as findings (GuardDuty, Security Hub)
- Others return empty findings when no resources exist (EFS, RDS, Lambda)

## Next Steps (TODOs)

### High Priority

1. ✅ ~~Research and map additional NIST 800-53 controls~~ (COMPLETED)
2. **Add comprehensive AWS security checks for OWASP framework** (CHECK-041 to CHECK-055)
3. **Add comprehensive AWS security checks for MITRE ATT&CK framework** (CHECK-056 to CHECK-065)
4. **Add comprehensive AWS security checks for CIS AWS Benchmark** (CHECK-066 to CHECK-070)
5. **Add comprehensive AWS security checks for AWS Well-Architected framework** (CHECK-071 to CHECK-075)

### Medium Priority

1. **Enhance reports to show passed check details under each control**
   - Currently only shows failures
   - Add section for passed checks grouped by control

2. **Add detailed check descriptions column to CSV reports**
   - Include check description in CSV output
   - Add remediation guidance column

3. **Improve executive summary statistics in reports**
   - Add control coverage percentage
   - Add severity distribution charts
   - Add framework alignment summary

4. **Update README and documentation to match new checks**
   - Document all 40 checks
   - Update architecture diagrams
   - Add usage examples

5. **Optimize performance for longer running scripts**
    - Implement parallel execution for multi-region checks
    - Add caching for account-level information
    - Implement exponential backoff for rate limiting
